Regarding the use of songs


The songs published on this site may be used freely for non-commercial purposes such as SNS, video posting, distribution, games, the web, etc. (There is no need to contact us, but you can use them in one place. Please write the song title/artist name.)

As an exception, you can use it for commercial purposes as long as you are not directly making money from it for personal use (for example, if you make money from your own videos, but videos that use my music) (For example, if you use it without monetizing it.)

Some songs are registered with content IDs, so advertisements may be automatically inserted on YouTube, but this will not cause any problems when used.

For commercial use, please click here for songs managed by EMP Co., Ltd. (such as " Nyan Cat " and " Nekomimi Switch ") , and for other inquiries, please contact us using the contact information above.


Regarding use of content

The contents published on this site and the products of the contents (e.g. songs generated with automatic composer ) may be used freely on SNS, video posting/distribution, games, the web, etc., regardless of whether they are commercial or non-commercial. Feel free to use it (there is no need to contact us, but please write the site name/site URL somewhere).

If you wish to use the site for commercial purposes as a corporation, please contact us just in case. However, even if it is for advertising purposes, there is no need to contact us if the composition is simply shared on SNS (for example, tweeting a composition by entering the name of your company's product on Automatic Composer ).

If the content you wish to use clearly specifies usage terms, or if it includes material that is not my copyrighted work (such as Hatsune Miku characters), please give priority to those terms and conditions.

Please refrain from selling the products as is (for example, selling the products as raw materials).

This site basically operates without posting advertisements.
If you like the music I create, I would be very happy if you could purchase it from here , as it would be a great help to the site management.
